What Is This?

This mod adds the ability to attach grenades to Alarm Clocks. When the alarm clock stops ringing, the grenade explodes.

If a player turns the alarm off while it's ringing the grenade will not explode. It will only explode if the timer runs out.

It's great for getting rid of groups of zombies, and/or overly curious players.

It's a very simple mod, it doesn't have any custom proxies or animations and it doesn't work with smoke grenades, but it works fine with vanilla grenades and flashbangs. I haven't tested modded grenades but it should work with any grenade that doesn't have "smoke" in its class type name (and the grenade must be designed to explode when ruined).

Installation:

Install it the same as any other mod - subscribe to it, copy the @ZenTimeBomb folder into your server folder, copy the ".bikey" file out of the mod keys folder into your server's keys folder. The mod is required on both server and client.

Repacking & Source Code:
You can repack this mod if you want to, although keep in mind any bug fixes I make won't automatically apply to your repacked version (although this is a very simple mod and shouldn't have any bugs anyway). As with all my mods, the source code is on my GitHub (www.zenarchist.io) and you can use it however you like. Enjoy :)
